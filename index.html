                    I started hiking seriously when I was around 15. Since
                    then I've covered 8 of the the 48 peaks over 4000' in 
                    the northeast United States, as well as trails in 
                    Missouri and Wisconsin. I have many more planned, around
                    the world.

                    Currently my goal is, at minimum, get what is called the 
                    "Presidential Traverse" done. This is a multi-day hike 
                    across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Range">Presidential Range</a>
                    in New Hampshire. The weather can be unpredictable and
                    the hike itself is fairly strenuous. However, this isn't
                    my main goal. I want to finish the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Trail">Long Trail</a>
                    , a 2-3 week hike that runs the length of Vermont.

                    I have many more I'd like to do, such as the Pacific Northwest
                    Trail, and Mt. McKinley in Alaska. I don't know if I'd want to 
                    do Everest or not. But regardless, the journey of a thousand
                    miles begins with the first step.
